# Next.js 15 Server Components Race Condition

This repository demonstrates a race condition bug that can occur in Next.js 15 when using server components with deeply nested data fetching. The parent component might render before all child components' data is available, resulting in an incomplete or inaccurate UI.  The solution provided showcases how to handle asynchronous data fetching and loading states effectively.

## Bug Description

The bug manifests as an incomplete UI rendering due to a race condition in server components.  When data fetching involves multiple asynchronous operations across nested components, the parent component might render prematurely with placeholder data before the nested data is resolved.

## Solution

The solution involves proper loading state management.  The parent component waits for all data to be ready before rendering to avoid displaying incomplete data.
